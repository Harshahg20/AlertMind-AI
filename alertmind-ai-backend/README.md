# AlertMind AI Backend

## Overview
The AlertMind AI backend is a FastAPI application designed to manage alerts, clients, and analytics while leveraging AI/ML components for enhanced alert processing and resolution. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for alert management in various applications.

## Features
- **Alert Management**: Create, update, and delete alerts with real-time processing.
- **Client Management**: Manage client information and their associated alerts.
- **Analytics**: Generate insights and reports based on alert data.
- **AI/ML Integration**: Utilize machine learning algorithms for alert correlation, prioritization, and auto-resolution.
